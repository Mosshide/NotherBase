<p>
    You enter a ghost town. This is the public square,
    or at least that's what it seemed to be at one point.
</p>

<p>
    There is an inn along one side of the square. It had
    two stories at one point, but now you only see the one
    and a half stories that the fire failed to consume.
</p>

<p>
    You see the color of bricks on the other side. There's
    probably nothing there.
</p>

<p>
    A rocky road leads out of the town opposite you. It
    points to a tower off in the distance.
