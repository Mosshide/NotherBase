        <p>
            All that we do and say must honor and glorify our Lord Jesus Christ. 
            We believe that churches are called to live and labor in the love of the Creator by doing, sharing 
            and growing in His goodness as they endeavor to reveal and share the love of Christ to others in all
            aspects of their lives.  (cf. Romans 12:2)

        <h3>An Instrument of Transformation</h3>
        <p>
            The Scriptures urge us to not be conformed to the patterns of this world, but instead to be vessels of God’s
            purpose on earth.  Through the gifts given us, our actions, words and deeds become opportunities for ministry
            and leadership as God’s instruments through instruction, correction and guidance.  (cf. 2 Timothy 3:16-17; 
            Romans 12:1-2; 2 Corinthians 3:18)
