                    This is a Node.js package that is in development along with NotherBase.
                    It adapts Express.js so I can produce content quicker.

                    Cannabis Product Diary helps you keep track of your purchased cannabis products and
                    the experiences garnered from these products. I find that large sites like Leafly
                    fail to provide any accurate information about the products at local dispensaries,
                    so this app is useful for anyone wanting to keep track of details about the local
                    products they've purchased.

                    Tamago Watch is a virtual toy based off the classic Tamagotchi toy. I focused on
                    making this toy rigid and consistent, so that it may invoke the feeling of real-life
                    hardware. Just like the real toy, the Tamago Watch is arguably more fun to discover
                    than to actually play for any extended period of time.

                    Won Ventures is a stock-trading site built by 
                    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanmichaelpark/">Jon Park</a> and myself.
                    The project is a practice on reverse-engineering CRUD functionality from other 
                    sites. In this case, we modeled after sites like Robinhood. A large focus was
                    gaining collaboration experience. This was fun team project and it was
                    a pleasure to work with Jon.

                    they were satisfied with our work.
